# IDG5259-SEM2-Final-Project-Matthew-Damato

The purpose of this project is to create a unique set of towers procedurally for a tower defense game

The script which handles the generation of these towers in the final implementation is called the "Tower Creation Script".

The previous iterations can be found in the "Build manager", "TowerGeneration", and "GameManager" scripts.

The environment was designed and coded from scratch to support these scripts. it is highly variable however, and can be edited to better suit different parameters.

The final set of results are saved in the folders under "Results to Process". Other folders in the results folder contain data on previous attempts and their performances.
